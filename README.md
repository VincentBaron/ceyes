# CEYES üïµÔ∏è

This is a command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Go that allows you to view CI/CD pipelines. I was so tired of using gitlab's shitty interface and wanted to not be interrupted in my workflow when managing my CI/CD pipelines. Hence this project is a POC to visualise your gitlab pipelines for all your projects. As it goes on, I will keep on implementing new features such as cancelling specific jobs, relaunching failed jobs, etc. Potentially, I will create a UI as I think it will quickly get too complex to be managed via the cli. Let me know if you have any suggestion!
